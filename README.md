## Synopsis

A module to help automate the cleanup of old log files and temp files on your systems.

## Description

The Cleaners do the dirty work in your servers for you. We take care of temp files, IIS logs, Exchange Server logs, and more!

## Why

- For all those hours spent manually clearing old IIS logs, Exchange logs, and temp files when a server disk gets low on space.
- For those teammates who get woken up at night while on call because a disk hit 90% full.
- For the fun of writing something useful in PowerShell that will hopefully make somebody's day easier!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

PowerShell or Windows PowerShell 5.1

There are no other strict dependencies, but the following can make things a little easier:

- IIS: WebManagement Module
- Exchange: Exchange Management Tools

### Installation

```powershell
# How to install TheCleaners
Install-Module -Name TheCleaners -AllowPrerelease
```

### Quick Start

#### Example1

```powershell
# See what jobs TheCleaners can do for you.

```
